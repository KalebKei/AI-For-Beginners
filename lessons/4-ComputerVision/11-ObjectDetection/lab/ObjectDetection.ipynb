    "# Head Detection using Hollywood Heads Dataset\n",

    "## Task\n",
    "\n",
    "Counting number of people on video surveillance camera stream is an important task that will allow us to estimate the number of visitors in a shops, busy hours in a restaurant, etc. To solve this task, we need to be able to detect human heads from different angles. To train object detection model to detect human heads, we can use [Hollywood Heads Dataset](https://www.di.ens.fr/willow/research/headdetection/).\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "[Hollywood Heads Dataset](https://www.di.ens.fr/willow/research/headdetection/release/HollywoodHeads.zip) contains 369,846 human heads annotated in 224,740 movie frames from Hollywood movies. It is provided in [https://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/](PASCAL VOC) format, where for each image there is also an XML description file that looks like this:\n",

    "In this dataset, there is only one class of objects `head`, and for each head, you get the coordinates of the bounding box. You can parse XML using Python libraries, or use [this library](https://pypi.org/project/pascal-voc/) to deal directly with PASCAL VOC format.\n",

    "## Training Object Detection \n",
    "\n",
    "You can train an object detection model using one of the following ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Using [Azure Custom Vision](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/custom-vision-service/quickstarts/object-detection?tabs=visual-studio&WT.mc_id=academic-77998-cacaste) and it's Python API to programmatically train the model in the cloud. Custom vision will not be able to use more than a few hundred images for training the model, so you may need to limit the dataset.\n",
    "* Using the example from [Keras tutorial](https://keras.io/examples/vision/retinanet/) to train RetunaNet model.\n",
    "* Using [torchvision.models.detection.RetinaNet](https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/_modules/torchvision/models/detection/retinanet.html) build-in module in torchvision.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Takeaway\n",
    "\n",
    "Object detection is a task that is frequently required in industry. While there are some services that can be used to perform object detection (such as [Azure Custom Vision](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/custom-vision-service/quickstarts/object-detection?tabs=visual-studio&WT.mc_id=academic-77998-cacaste)), it is important to understand how object detection works and to be able to train your own models.
